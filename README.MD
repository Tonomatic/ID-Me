# Project: Sales Engineer Assessment

Using an existing sample code project on ID.me Developer, I  will demonstrate the use of ID.me authentication by having a user press an ID.me Button, having the user redirected to complete verification, and if verified sucessfully, retrieve user's attributes and display them!

If there's an error with ClientID or subgroup match, alert that an error has occured and return.

## Testing project

1. Install node
2. npm install -g serve
3. serve -p 3000

Run `http://localhost:3000`
